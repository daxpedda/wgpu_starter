# **WGPU starter with Winit 0.30.5 and WGPU version 23.0.1**

_Date: 14/12/2024_

## **What is it?**

This is an example as an introduction to **WGPU**. In this example we simply draw the famous triangle on a window.
This is based on the example from Learn **WGPU** (https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) but refactored to update to the latest lib/API version.
I also took inspiration from the Youtube series from GetIntoGameDev  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Uf7akOYo0).

## Why?

Winit 0.30.5 has introduced breaking changes to its API. The examples on Learn GPU and GetIntoGameDev, no longer work with latest version of **Winit** and WGPU.
I had troubles finding online documentation for **Winit** updated API.

Luckily I found this brilliant code that resolves the issue:

So credit to them!
The refactoring around the window is neat using ARC to be able to get a reference on a mutable reference asynchronously.

## **How to run it?**

- for the desktop version simply run:

  ```bash
  > cargo run 
  ```

- for the WASM browser version, you can install Trunk (https://trunkrs.dev/) and run :

  ```bash
  > trunk serve
  ```

  And open your navigator and enter the URL. Default is http://127.0.0.1:8080/
